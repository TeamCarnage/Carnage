# Carnage
Carnage (formally Blood Is Fuel) is a Minecraft Mod developed by Colonel, Deamoz, DiaDuck, and tman; bringing a more fast-paced and skillful style of PvP to Minecraft Java.\
It is still in wildly early development! The project was started in late December 2024.\
Will it ever be finished? Who knows!

## How to Contribute! (Using IntelliJ IDEA)

### 1. Fork the repository
- Navigate to the repository, thats *probably* the page you're on right now!
- On the top-right, click the **Fork** button to create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

### 2. Clone your fork
- Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to **File > New > Project from Version Control > Git**.
- In the **Git Repository URL** field, paste the URL of your forked repository from GitHub.
- Choose the directory where you want to clone the repository and click **Clone**.

### 3. Set up the original repository as a remote (optional)
- Open the **Git** tool window in IntelliJ by going to **View > Tool Windows > Git**.
- Go to **Git > Manage Remotes**.
- Click the **+** button to add a remote, and enter the URL of the original repository (upstream).
- Click **OK** to save.

To sync your fork later, you can fetch and merge the changes by going to **Git > Fetch** and then using **Git > Merge**.

### 4. Create a new branch
- In the **Git** tool window, click the **Current Branch** dropdown.
- Select **New Branch**, and give your branch a descriptive name (e.g., `feature-name`).
- Click **Create** to switch to the new branch.

### 5. Make changes
- Open the files you want to edit in the editor.
- Use IntelliJ IDEA’s code editing tools to make your changes.

### 6. Commit your changes
- After making the changes, go to the **Git** tool window, and click the **Commit** button.
- In the **Commit Changes** dialog, review the files you’ve modified.
- Write a meaningful commit message describing the changes you've made.
- Click **Commit** to save the changes locally, or **Commit and Push** to push them to your forked repository directly.

### 7. Push your changes
- If you committed your changes locally first, go to **Git > Push** or use the **Push** button in the Git tool window.
- Choose the branch you want to push to and click **Push** to upload the changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

### 8. Create a pull request (PR)
- Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
- You will see a banner prompting you to create a pull request. Click **Compare & Pull Request**.
- Add a clear description of the changes you made and why they are useful.
- Click **Create Pull Request**.

### 9. Review and follow up
- After submitting your PR, we will review your changes. We could ask you to make adjustments or changes.
- If we request changes, make the updates and commit them in IntelliJ IDEA. Then, push the changes to the same branch, and they will automatically update the PR.
- If we dont request changes, i'll merge it with the project!! Thanks for helping us out :heart:
